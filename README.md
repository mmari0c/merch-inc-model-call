# Merch Inc Model Call

A web platform to streamline the **model call process** for Merch Inc.’s biannual fashion shows.  

This project replaces the current messy, manual process (shared laptops, forgotten numbers, confusing picks) with a **simple, transparent, and organized system**.

## Problem

Every semester, Merch Inc. hosts a fashion show where designers select models for their collections.  
Currently, the model call process is slowed down by:

- Manual sign-ups on a limited number of laptops  
- Models forgetting their assigned numbers  
- Designers struggling to track which models are available versus already selected  
- Designers relying on memory to keep track of models they’re interested in  
- Models lacking clarity on whether they’ve been selected  
- Limited ways for models to showcase themselves beyond a runway walk  

In addition to the in-person model call, Merch Inc. often hosts a virtual model call for designers who are unable to attend and for models who were not selected initially. However, this process is also inefficient and difficult to manage.

## Solution

This project addresses these challenges by providing:

- A centralized sign-up portal for both models and designers  
- Model profiles with photos, key details, and assigned model numbers  
- A marketplace-style interface for designers to browse and evaluate models  
- A transparent selection system with real-time updates  
- An admin dashboard to manage stages and export results

This project enables:

- Models who were not selected during the initial model call to still participate in the show  
- Designers to easily view and evaluate models who remain available after the original model call
