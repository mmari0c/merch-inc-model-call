# Merch Inc Model Call

A web platform to streamline the **model call process** for Merch Inc.’s biannual fashion shows.  

This project replaces the current messy, manual process (shared laptops, forgotten numbers, confusing picks) with a **simple, transparent, and organized system**.

## Overview
Every semester, Merch Inc. hosts a fashion show where designers select models for their collection. Currently, the process is slowed down by:

- Manual sign-ups on a limited number of laptops
- Models forgetting their assigned numbers
- Designers struggling to track which models are available versus already selected
- Designers relying on memory to keep track of models they’re interested in
- Models are unsure whether they’ve been selected
- Models have limited ways to showcase themselves beyond a runway walk

This project addresses these challenges by providing:

- A centralized sign-up portal for both models and designers
- Model profiles with photos, key details, and assigned model numbers
- A marketplace-style interface for designers to browse and evaluate models
- A transparent selection system with real-time updates
- An admin dashboard to manage stages and export results
